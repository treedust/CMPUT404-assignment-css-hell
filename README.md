PART 1
=================
Removed gutenburg inline css then added my css document to be part of of how the html is displayed with a link tag <link href="gutenburg.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">.
As well have added a div with the class scroll to the contents table/blockquote
Move the CONTENTS title outside of the blockquote and div with class scroll
for war and peace so it would not be part of the scrolling div

PART 2
